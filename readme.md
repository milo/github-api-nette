# Introduction
This is the [Nette Framework](https://nette.org) extension for [milo/github-api](https://github.com/milo/github-api) library. It brings you:

- prepared presenter for sign-in and sign-out actions
- Tracy panel
- `Milo\Github\Api` service in container
- and few more things...


# Installation
The master branch is compatible with Nette 2.4. For Nette 2.0-2.3 use branches v2.1 and v2.2 (but they are not maintained anymore).

If you hit the problem open an [issue](https://github.com/milo/github-api-nette/issues) please.

For installation use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):
```
composer require milo/github-api-nette @dev
```

Register the extension in `config.neon`:
```
extensions:
	github: Milo\Github\NetteExtension\Extension(%debugMode%)
```


Since you register the extension you get a new service in DI container:
- `github.api` is instance of `Milo\Github\Api`

And when you set `clientId` and `clientSecret` (mentioned later) in config file, you get next two:
- `github.login` is instance of `Milo\Github\OAuth\Login`
- `github.user` is instance of `Milo\Github\NetteExtension\User`


# Configuration
Extension works without any configuration. But your Github API requests will be rate limited and non-authenticated.

Configure the extension in `config.neon`. If you have one static token, you can set it manualy:
```
github:
	auth:
		token: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

If you want to obtain the token dynamically by authentication procedure, set the `clientId` and `clientSecret`:
```
github:
	auth:
		clientId: 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'
		clientSecret: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

You can use both simultaneously. The token obtained by authentication will be used when obtained.


Whole configuration:
```
services:
	ownClient: Milo\Github\Http\StreamClient

github:
	cached: FALSE       # (default TRUE) read below...
	client: @ownClient  # (default NULL) set own HTTP client
	auth:
		token: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
		clientId: 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'
		clientSecret: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
		scopes: ['user', 'repo']  # (default [])
```


# Caching
The `cached` configuration option controls caching mechanism.
- `FALSE` - no caching will be used

With following, `Http\CachedClient` will be used:
- `TRUE` - updates will be checked every request
- `(int)` - updates will not be checked for int seconds
- `INF` - updates will never be checked (permanent cache)

**WARNING** - Values `(int)` and `INF` are for development purpose only and should never be used in production. It's because the cache may be outdated and Github may hold newer data.


# Authentication
To help with OAuth token obtaining, there is a prepared abstract `Milo\Github\NetteExtension\Presenter` for you. Use it in your application as:
```php
namespace App\Presenters;

class GithubPresenter extends Milo\Github\NetteExtension\Presenter
{
	# Called after successfull authentication on Github web page
	public function actionSignInRedirect()
	{
		$this->flashMessage('Signed IN');
		$this->redirect('Homepage:');
	}


	# Called on logging out
	public function actionSignOutRedirect()
	{
		$this->flashMessage('Signed OUT');
		$this->redirect('Homepage:');
	}
}
```

Create links or redirect to following presenter actions in a usual way:
- `Github:signIn` for logging in
- `Github:signOut` for logging out

**NOTE**: The prepared presenter requires clientId and clientSecret to be configured.

Even you are or you are not authenticated, you have a `github.user` [Milo\Github\NetteExtension\User](https://github.com/milo/github-api-nette/blob/master/src/NetteExtension/User.php) service in DI container. You can check `$user->isLoggedIn()` and get some basic user info like, login, name, avatar URL...
