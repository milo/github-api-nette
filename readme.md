# Introduction
This is the [Nette Framework](http://nette.org) extension for [milo/github-api](https://github.com/milo/github-api) library use. It brings you:

- presenter prepared for sign-in and sign-out actions
- Tracy panel
- `Milo\Github\Api` service in container
- and few more things...


# Installation
The extension is compatible with Nette 2.0.x, 2.1.x and 2.2.x. I'm keeping it compatible with development branch. If you hit the problem, please, open an [issue](https://github.com/milo/github-api-nette/issues).

For installation use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):
```
composer require milo/github-api-nette @dev
```

With Nette 2.0.x register the extension in bootstrap:
```php
Milo\Github\NetteExtension\Extension::register($configurator);
```

With a newer Nette version register the extension in `config.neon`:
```
extensions:
	github: Milo\Github\NetteExtension\Extension
```

Since you register the extension you get a new service in DI container:
- `github.api -> Milo\Github\Api`

And when you set `clientId` and `clientSecret` (mentioned later) in config file, you get next two:
- `github.login -> Milo\Github\OAuth\Login`
- `github.user -> Milo\Github\NetteExtension\User`


# Configuration
Extension works without any configuration. But your Github API requests will be rate limited and non-authenticated.

Configure the extension in `config.neon`, add secrets to enable the authentication. Now, you are still non-authenticated but your rate limit is higher:
```
github:
	auth:
		clientId: 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'
		clientSecret: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

Advanced configuration:
```
services:
	ownClient: Milo\Github\Http\StreamClient

github:
	cached: FALSE       # (default TRUE) disable HTTP caching (Http\CachedClient will not be used)
	client: @ownClient  # (default NULL) set own HTTP client
	auth:
		clientId: 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'
		clientSecret: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
		scopes: ['user', 'repo']  # (default [])
```


# Authentication
To help with OAuth token obtaining, there is a prepared abstract `Milo\Github\NetteExtension\Presenter` for you. Use it in your application as:
```php
namespace App\Module\Presenters;

class GithubPresenter extends Milo\Github\NetteExtension\Presenter
{
	# Called after successfull authentication on Github web page
	public function actionSignInRedirect()
	{
		$this->flashMessage('Signed IN');
		$this->redirect('Homepage:');
	}


	# Called on logging out
	public function actionSignOutRedirect()
	{
		$this->flashMessage('Signed OUT');
		$this->redirect('Homepage:');
	}
}
```

Create links or redirect to following presenter actions in a usual way:
- `Module:Presenter:signIn` for logging in
- `Module:Presenter:signOut` for logging out

Even you are or you are not authenticated, you have a `github.user` [Milo\Github\NetteExtension\User](https://github.com/milo/github-api-nette/blob/master/src/NetteExtension/User.php) service in DI container. You can check `$user->isLoggedIn()` and get some basic user info like, login, name, avatar URL...
